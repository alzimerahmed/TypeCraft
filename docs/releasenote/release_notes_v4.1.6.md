## 🚀 What's New in v4.1.6

- **Ultra-Lightweight APKs (~9.8 MB)**: Unbundled dictionaries across all flavors in favor of on-demand downloads via DictManager, dramatically reducing baseline download size and storage footprint.
- **Modular Offline AI Dynamic Plugin**: Decoupled the local GGUF AI engine into a standalone dynamic plugin (`LeanType-Offline-AI-Plugin`), keeping the core keyboard fast and lean.
- **Instant Offline Translation Hot-Reload & Persistence**: Direct filesystem inspection and proactive plugin cache invalidation ensure imported translation models (`.zip`) are instantly recognized and retained across dialog reopenings without requiring a keyboard restart.
- **Refined Setup Wizard & Unified Plugins Hub**: Streamlined the Welcome Wizard across all flavors and integrated Offline AI into the centralized Plugins Hub alongside Voice, Handwriting, and Translation.

> ⚠️ **Important Notice for Offline & Offline Lite Users**:
> - **Offline AI Plugin Detachment**: The local GGUF AI engine is now modularized into the standalone [**`LeanType-Offline-AI-Plugin`**](https://github.com/LeanBitLab/LeanType-Offline-AI-Plugin). Existing **Offline** flavor users are recommended to **backup their settings** (**Settings &rarr; Advanced &rarr; Backup**) before updating just in case. After updating, simply load the Offline AI Plugin from **Settings &rarr; Plugins &rarr; Offline AI** to continue using local GGUF model proofreading.
> - **Offline Lite Users**: In the upcoming release, `offline` and `offlinelite` will merge into a single unified lightweight Offline edition with optional Offline AI plugin support.
