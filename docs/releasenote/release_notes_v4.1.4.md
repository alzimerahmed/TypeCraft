## 🚀 What's New in v4.1.4

### ✨ New Features & Enhancements

- **Offline Handwriting & Translation Everywhere**: Offline handwriting recognition and translation plugins are now fully supported across all app flavors (Standard, Standard Full, Offline, and Offline Lite).
- **ML Kit Isolated into Plugins**: Google ML Kit has been completely removed from the core keyboard and isolated into standalone companion plugins.
- **Offline Model Downloader & Importer**: In-app model downloads for online flavors and direct browser download popups + multi-file import for offline flavors.
- **Unified Plugins Dashboard**: Reorganized settings with a single Plugins hub showing active status and automated update checks for Voice and Handwriting plugins.

- **Smart Text Expander**: Added handy clipboard modifiers (`%clipboard:clean%`, `:singleline`, `:title`, `:slug`, `:upper`, `:replace`) that automatically clean Wikipedia citations and format text.

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- **Emoticon Fix**: Typing emoticons like `:)` and `:(` no longer resets the symbol keyboard back to letters.
- **Personal Dictionary**: Fixed word auto-learning so new words are properly saved based on your configured threshold.
- **Handwriting Tag Fix**: Fixed model loading so regional languages (like English Australia or Hindi) load without affecting other language variants.
- **Emoji Search Setting**: Strictly honored the inline emoji search toggle when turned off.
